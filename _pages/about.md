# Welcome! 
 I am a Master's student at the Beijing Institute of Technology, advised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.cz/citations?user=0PJAjX4AAAAJ&hl">Shuxiang Guo</a>.  My research interests include LLM post-training,medical image analysis and surgical robotics. I have contributed to multiple projects in these areas, resulting in several publications in top-tier venues such as IEEE JSTARS, IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics, and MICCAI.

  - **Designed a sophisticated dual-model architecture (VLM + LLM) featuring a Divergence Arbitration Mechanism.** To enhance system reliability, I moved beyond single-model approaches. My system processes inputs with both Vision-Language and Large Language Models, then intelligently compares their outputs. In cases of disagreement, a custom-built arbitration mechanism uses expert-knowledge routing and, for highly ambiguous cases, triggers a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) re-evaluation to ensure final decision quality and robustness.
  Engineered a two-stage data synthesis pipeline to address the cold-start problem,
  - **Engineered a two-stage data synthesis pipeline to solve the cold-start problem, expanding the original dataset of 1,000 real-world business data into a high-quality training set of 10,000 samples.**. I implemented a Generate-Critique strategy, using Qwen-Max and DeepSeek-R1 for cost-effective data generation and more powerful models like GPT-4o for quality validation. Central to this was CoT Distillation‚Äîemployed a teacher model to generate reasoning paths, then distilled this "think flow" into a synthetic dataset, enabling smaller fine-tuned models (7B‚Äì32B) to learn not just answers but the underlying reasoning process, thereby constructing a CoT dataset.
  - **Established a rigorous, multi-level evaluation framework focused on real-world performance and high-risk scenarios.** Beyond achieving a macro accuracy of 77.6%, I built a fine-grained evaluation system based on a 20-category confusion matrix. This allowed for the identification of specific weaknesses and the implementation of strict recall targets for critical, high-risk categories, ensuring the system met stringent safety and reliability standards.
  - **Future Research Direction**: The experience of building a robust reasoning and arbitration system has solidified my research interests. I've seen firsthand how standard SFT can fail in nuanced situations. This drives my passion to explore next-generation alignment techniques like DPO and RLHF, to build models that are not just accurate, but genuinely trustworthy and aligned with complex human preferences.
